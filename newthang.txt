
what is the world and setting?

first part of the story takes place in a temperate forest
being overlooked by a mountain range with creeks and rivers.

***a small community of isolated people (the Duneda√≠n)
protect an ancient evil from beneath the mountain. 
dark age/medieval tech.They are guardians of the forest and its perimeter.
They cannot talk to animals.

***an intimidating desert is to the west. a sickly coyote, covered in ticks lays near motionless. 
the ***BADTHING*** will give the near death coyote cosmic undeath. infecting its blood and the ticks.
the ticks and coyote meld together.


***The animals in the forest live in relative harmony
the squirrels do squirrel things, the raccoons do raccoon things, etc

the animals do talk to each other. but there are limitations.
example. a Bee cant communicate with a rat or squirrel. 
but a squirrel can talk to the rat. Rules are they are different kinds.(insect != mammal, mammal != bird)

***there is magic but its rare.

*** The raccoon needs to find an acorn, a rock, a stick, and some leaves.
it does this as an annual raccoon ritual lasting until the end of the season.
of age raccoons go out and start finding items to impress their mate-crush.

Atop a great pine tree the three friends met at twilight. the town next to the mountain glittered a little with lanterns
in the distance. Two moons peaked behind the mountains. 3 young furry animals talked on a large branch

OPOSSUM: " So you're really going to go into town?"

RACCOON: " Yea, and I was hoping you two come with me..." "I asked my uncle, he says its not against the rules.
Just that I have to be the one to acquire it."

SQUIRREL:"...*yawn*, i usually start sleep though..."

OPOSSUM: " Oh come on you have to go with us SQUIRREL"
RACCOON: " Plus I have an extra insentive!"

***Reveals some honey wrapped in a leaf***

SQUIRREL: "...is...is that..."
RACCOON: " Honey? So glad you noticed!"

ROLL = CONVINCE THE SQUIRREL TO GO =

-just roll? 
-dialogue battle? 
-puzzle? 
-consequences??
